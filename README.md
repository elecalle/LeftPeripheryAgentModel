# Left Periphery Simulation Model

This repository contains a simulation model of word order of the **left periphery** of a sentence, implemented in NetLogo. The model demonstrates how syntactic elements (e.g., topics, focus elements, modifiers) interact and organize dynamically based on local rules, offering insights into word order phenomena inspired by syntactic theory and complexity science.

## Features

- Simulates the behavior and reordering of left-peripheral constituents using precedence and mutual exclusivity rules.
- Includes two update methods for evaluation: **Cascade** and **Strict Pairwise**, which influence the dynamics of reordering.
- Offers flexible initialization options (random setup, manual configuration, predefined configurations).
- Visualizes the incremental reorganization of elements row by row.

## Running the Simulation

### Option 1: NetLogo Desktop

1. Download the `.nlogo` file from the repository.
2. Open the file in the NetLogo desktop application (version 6.0 or higher).
3. Use the setup options and run the simulation using the "Go" button.

### Option 2: NetLogo Web

You can also run the simulation through **NetLogo Web** without installing NetLogo locally:

1. Download the `.html` file from the repository.
2. Open the file in your web browser.
3. Use the interface to set up and run the simulation.

## Documentation

For an explanation of the simulation, including the types of patch states, rules governing interactions, and examples of configurations, refer to the `WHAT IS IT?` section in the NetLogo interface.
